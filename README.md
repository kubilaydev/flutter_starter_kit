# flutter_starter_kit
 It's a clean start for your new Flutter app with Flutter Starter Kit

ADDED THIS SPECS:

FOLDERS : I added folders suit for atomic pattern

FONTS : I added some fonts for you. You can add yours very easy. Thank me later.

ASSETS : I added some assets file path in yaml file. Its ready to add assets and use directly.

CONSTS : Standard constants to be used within the entire application. I added some example in demo_main_page.dart

Effective DART : I have added what guides you to use the dart language effectively.
For remove this helps: 
delete 'effective_dart: any' line in pubspec.yaml and whole analysis_options.yaml file 

CLEAN START and Fallowing pages : main.dart file and your main app dart file has min line 
for easyly readable.
